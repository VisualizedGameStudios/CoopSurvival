What is the game about? Ths game for now is a single player Survival Horde Shooter. This version is a wave survival from armed AI and you have to clear all the waves. We plan to add different gamemodes in the future including Zombie Waves or just a plain Survival Mode were you survive. This game is still in early development. So if there is a demo released there wont be much added to it just yet. For now the only gamemode is the wave survival against Enemy AI. We will be adding much much more stuff later on. Including, More Weapons, Customizable Characters, More Gamemodes, Better User Interface, and possibly a better launch screen for the game.

This game may contain:

Violence
Blood & Gore
There will be no Nudity, Hard Language, Racism, Religious acts, or anything that involves making the game labled "Mature", "Disrespectful", or "Offensive"

In our rating this is known as a "T" Rated Game.
